<h2>Removal of previously deprecated functionality</h2>

<p>
  Staticcheck 2019.1 deprecated the <em>unused</em>, <em>gosimple</em>, and <em>megacheck</em>
  utilities, as they have been merged into <em>staticcheck</em>. This release
  no longer includes these utilities. Additionally, the <code>-ignore</code>
  flag has been removed.
</p>

<h2>Checks</h2>

Numerous new checks have been added in this release.

<h3>New checks</h3>
<p>
  S1033 - unnecessary guard around call to delete
</p>

<p>
  S1034 simplifies type switches involving redundant type assertions.
</p>

<p>
  SA1026 flags attempts at marshaling invalid types.
</p>

<p>
  SA1027 flags incorrectly aligned atomic accesses.
</p>

<p>
  SA4020 flags unreachable case clauses in type switches.
</p>

<p>
  SA4021 flags calls to append with a single argument,
  as <code>x = append(y)</code> is equivalent to <code>x = y</code>.
</p>

<p>
  SA5008 flags certain kinds of invalid struct tags.
</p>

<p>
  SA5009 verifies the correctness of Printf calls.
</p>

<p>
  SA6005 flags inefficient string comparisons involving
  strings.ToLower or strings.ToUpper when they can be replaced with
  strings.EqualFold.
</p>

<p>
  SA9005 flags attempts at marshaling structs with no public fields
  nor custom marshaling.
</p>

<p>
  ST1017 flags so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions">yoda conditions</a>,
  which take the form of <code>if 42 == x</code>.
</p>

<p>
  ST1018 flags string literals containing zero-width characters.
</p>
